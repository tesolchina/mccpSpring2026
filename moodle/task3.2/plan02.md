# Plan 02: Task 3.2 - Improving Your Writing Through Gap Analysis

## Purpose

**The key motivation:** This task is designed to help you **improve your writing skills** by identifying specific gaps between your current writing and excellent academic writing, then finding actionable strategies to fill those gaps.

---

## Part 1: Understanding the Writing Task

### What You Need to Write

Before analyzing model papers, you need to understand what you're working toward. Review the writing assignment requirements:

**File to read:** `writing_instructions_formatted.md`

**Key requirements:**
- Write 1000-1500 words (Introduction + Literature Review)
- Follow rhetorical moves discussed in Sessions 1 & 2
- Meet the assessment criteria for Task Achievement:
  - Extremely clear explanation of research background, focus, and objectives
  - Skilful paraphrase, synthesis, and critical evaluation of literature
  - Clearly delineated research gap
  - Succinctly highlighted significance of research
  - Adequate and effective use of sources, proper citations & referencing

**Action:** Read through `writing_instructions_formatted.md` carefully to understand:
- What the assignment requires
- What "Excellent" Task Achievement looks like according to the rubrics
- What rhetorical moves you need to include

## Part 2: The Core Motivation - Improving Your Writing

### Why This Task Matters

The goal of this task is **not just to analyze papers**, but to **improve your writing skills** for the assignment and beyond.

**How this task helps you improve:**
1. **Identifies specific gaps** in your current writing
2. **Shows you concrete examples** of how excellent writers achieve what you're struggling with
3. **Provides actionable strategies** you can immediately apply to your writing

**The improvement cycle:**
```
Your Current Writing → Identify Gaps → Analyze Model Papers → Extract Strategies → Apply to Your Writing → Improved Writing
```

## Part 3: Providing Your Writing Sample

### Why You Need a Writing Sample

To identify gaps, we need to see **where you are as a writer**. Your writing sample serves as the baseline for comparison.

**Create:** `writingSample.md`

**What to include:**
- A piece of your recent writing (Introduction and/or Literature Review section)
- **Preferably include supervisor comments or feedback** if available
- If you don't have recent writing, you can use:
  - A draft you're working on
  - Previous coursework (with permission)
  - A section from your thesis/proposal

**Format for `writingSample.md`:**

```markdown
# My Writing Sample

## Source
[Where this writing comes from - e.g., "Draft of my research proposal introduction", "Previous coursework with supervisor feedback"]

## Supervisor/Peer Comments (if available)
[Include any feedback you've received on this writing]

## My Writing

[Paste your writing here - Introduction and/or Literature Review section]

## My Reflection
[Briefly reflect on: What do you think are the strengths and weaknesses of this writing?]
```

**Important:** This writing sample is for **self-assessment and gap identification only**. It helps you understand your starting point.

## Part 4: Identifying the Gap

### The Gap Analysis Process

Now that you have:
1. ✅ Understanding of what excellent writing looks like (from assessment rubrics)
2. ✅ Your current writing sample (baseline)
3. ✅ Model papers from your target journals/conferences (target)

**Compare and identify gaps:**

**Step 1: Self-Assessment**
- Review your `writingSample.md` against the assessment rubrics
- Identify specific areas where your writing doesn't meet "Excellent" criteria
- Note any issues mentioned in supervisor comments

**Step 2: Compare with Model Papers**
- Select 2-3 model papers that demonstrate excellent Task Achievement
- Compare how they handle aspects you're struggling with
- Document specific differences

**Step 3: Describe Your Gap**
Create a clear gap description. For example:

> **Gap in Research Background:**
> - My writing: "Many studies have looked at this topic." (vague, no citations)
> - Excellent writing: "Recent research has demonstrated the critical importance of X (Author1, 2023; Author2, 2024), with particular emphasis on Y (Author3, 2024)." (specific, cited, evaluative)
> - **The gap:** I need to be more specific, include citations, and use evaluative language

## Part 5: Analyzing Model Papers to Find Solutions

### Focused Analysis Based on Your Gap

**Don't analyze everything** - focus on the specific gaps you identified.

**For each gap you identified:**

1. **Find examples in model papers** that demonstrate excellence in that area
2. **Extract specific strategies:**
   - What language patterns do they use?
   - How do they structure their arguments?
   - What linguistic features characterize their writing?
3. **Document with excerpts** showing before/after or your gap vs. their approach

**Example Analysis:**

**Gap:** "I struggle with gap identification - my gaps are vague"

**Model Paper Analysis:**
- **Excerpt from Model Paper 1:**
  > "However, despite extensive research on X, three critical limitations remain: (1) most studies focus on Y while neglecting Z, (2) methodological approaches have primarily relied on A without considering B, and (3) the theoretical framework has not adequately addressed C."
  
- **Strategy identified:**
  - Use "However, despite X" to signal transition to gap
  - Enumerate specific limitations (numbered list)
  - Be concrete about what's missing (Y vs. Z, A vs. B)
  
- **How I'll apply this:**
  - I will use similar transition phrases
  - I will enumerate my gaps clearly
  - I will be specific about what's missing rather than saying "more research is needed"

## Part 6: Creating Your Action Plan

### Document Your Findings

**Create:** `task_achievement_analysis.html`

**Structure your HTML report:**

1. **Gap Identification Section**
   - Your writing sample (excerpts)
   - Specific gaps identified
   - Comparison with assessment criteria

2. **Model Paper Analysis Section**
   - For each gap: how model papers address it
   - Excerpts from model papers
   - Strategies and patterns identified

3. **Action Plan Section**
   - Specific strategies you will use
   - How you'll apply them to your writing
   - Concrete examples of what you'll change
