# Overall Plan: Task 3.2 - Analyzing Model Papers for Task Achievement

## Purpose

This task helps you **identify the gap** between your current writing and excellent academic writing, then **gain actionable insights** from analyzing model papers to fill that gap.

---

## The Core Process

### Input
- **Writing Instructions**: Assessment requirements and rubrics (`writing_instructions_formatted.md`)
- **Course Materials**: Rhetorical moves, linguistic features, and examples from Sessions 1 & 2

### Goal
1. **Identify the gap** between:
   - Your current writing abilities
   - Excellent writing in published texts (model papers)
   - What you hope to achieve (your writing goals)

2. **Describe this gap** clearly

3. **Gain actionable insights** from analyzing model papers to fill the gap

---

## Simplified Workflow

### Phase 1: Understand What "Good Writing" Means
**What to do:**
- Review the assessment rubrics to understand what "Excellent" Task Achievement looks like
- Reflect on what counts as good writing in your research community
- Identify 2-3 model papers from your target journals/conferences

**Output:** A clear understanding of the standards you're aiming for

**Key Question:** *What does "excellent" writing look like in my field?*

---

### Phase 2: Identify Your Gap
**What to do:**
- Compare your current writing (or writing goals) with:
  - The assessment criteria (what "Excellent" means)
  - Model papers (what published excellent writing looks like)
- Identify specific areas where there's a gap:
  - Research background clarity?
  - Gap identification?
  - Literature synthesis?
  - Citation strategies?

**Output:** A description of the gap between where you are and where you want to be

**Key Question:** *What specific aspects of Task Achievement do I need to improve?*

---

### Phase 3: Analyze Model Papers to Find Solutions
**What to do:**
- Select 2-3 model papers that demonstrate excellent Task Achievement
- Analyze how they achieve excellence in the areas where you identified gaps
- Extract specific strategies, language patterns, and structures they use
- Document your findings with excerpts and explanations

**Output:** Actionable insights about how excellent writers achieve Task Achievement

**Key Question:** *How do excellent papers achieve what I'm struggling with?*

---

### Phase 4: Create Your Action Plan
**What to do:**
- Create an HTML report documenting:
  - The gap you identified
  - How model papers address this gap
  - Specific strategies and patterns you discovered
  - How you plan to apply these insights to your own writing

**Output:** A clear action plan with specific strategies to improve your writing

**Key Question:** *What specific strategies will I use to fill the gap?*

## The Gap-Filling Framework

```
Current Writing → [GAP] → Excellent Writing
                    ↓
            Analyze Model Papers
                    ↓
            Extract Strategies
                    ↓
            Apply to Your Writing
```

### Example Gap Identification

**Gap:** "I struggle to clearly delineate research gaps. My gap statements are often vague."

**Model Paper Analysis:** "Excellent papers use specific linguistic markers (e.g., 'However', 'Despite X, Y remains unclear') and provide concrete examples of what's missing."

**Actionable Insight:** "I will use similar gap-signaling phrases and provide specific examples of methodological or theoretical limitations."

## Success Criteria

You have successfully completed this task when you can:

1. ✅ **Clearly describe** the gap between your writing and excellent writing
2. ✅ **Identify specific strategies** from model papers that address your gap
3. ✅ **Create an action plan** with concrete steps to improve your writing
4. ✅ **Document your findings** in a clear, organized HTML report

---

## Tips

- **Start small**: Focus on 2-3 key aspects of Task Achievement rather than trying to cover everything
- **Be specific**: Instead of "I need to improve," identify exactly what needs improvement (e.g., "I need clearer gap identification")
- **Look for patterns**: When analyzing model papers, look for recurring strategies across multiple papers
- **Make it actionable**: Every insight should lead to a specific strategy you can apply

---

## Next Steps

1. Review the assessment rubrics and course materials
2. Reflect on your writing goals and current challenges
3. Select model papers that demonstrate excellence in areas you want to improve
4. Analyze and document your findings
5. Create your HTML report and submit in Moodle

**Remember:** The goal is not just to analyze papers, but to identify your gap and find actionable ways to fill it.
