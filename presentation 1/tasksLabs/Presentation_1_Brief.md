**Oral Presentation Assessment 1 -- Research Story-telling by Experienced Writers**

Date: **Sessions 5 & 6**
Weighting: 20%

### INSTRUCTIONS:

You will give an 8-minute presentation on **an empirical journal article** in your field to a non-specialist audience and explain **how experienced writers strategically tell their research stories** in writing. You should:

1). give a brief **introduction** to the article
2). briefly explain the **key findings**
3). highlight the **significance** of the research
4). elucidate how this article may **impact your own research design** and what **good writing skills** you have learned from this article, with **convincing evidence** taken from the article

Your presentation needs to be **well-structured,** and the content should be **intelligible to laypeople who have no/little knowledge of your field**. Hence, **highly technical terms should be avoided**. Visual aids, such as PowerPoint slides are required. Please refer to Session 4 handouts for details about academic presentation skills and strategies for explaining disciplinary concepts and knowledge to a non-specialist audience.

You should **upload the presentation slides** to a folder shared by the class lecturer **at least** **two hours before the assessment**.

Note cards with key points may be used during the presentation; however, reading directly from a script is not permitted and will result in a failing grade for the assessment.

### NOTE:

- You will need to evaluate two to four of your classmates' presentations and provide peer feedback using a peer evaluation form. Your lecturer will tell you about the arrangements.
- The reviewers should:
    1. Raise questions during the Q&A session
    2. Complete the evaluation forms
