# 10 Additional Activity Ideas for Academic Writing & AI Integration

## Activity 1.5: Micro-Level Linguistic Analysis (Nominalization & Hedging)
**Objective**: CILO 3 (Linguistic Features)
- **Input**: `Session 1 Handout` (Nominalization section), a draft paragraph from student research.
- **Process**: Students use AI to identify all verbs/adjectives in their paragraph and experiment with nominalizing them to increase conciseness. Then, use AI to identify "absolute" statements and apply appropriate hedging.
- **Output**: A "Before & After" comparison table of a research paragraph.
- **Learning/Insights**: Students learn how grammatical choices affect the "formality" and "caution" of academic claims.
- **Tutor Contribution**: Dr. Wang can review the "After" version to ensure nominalization hasn't led to "lexical density" that obscures meaning.

## Activity 1.6: Rhetorical Move Mapping of the Abstract
**Objective**: CILO 2 (Generic Features)
- **Input**: 3 abstracts from top-tier journals in the student's specific field.
- **Process**: Use AI to color-code the "Moves" within the abstract (Background → Gap → Purpose → Method → Result → Conclusion).
- **Output**: A structural map of abstracts in their sub-discipline.
- **Learning/Insights**: Understanding that even short texts have a rigorous macro-level structure; helps in writing the "selling point" of the paper.
- **Tutor Contribution**: Dr. Wang provides feedback on whether the "Gap" move in the abstract is sufficiently compelling for a general academic audience.

## Activity 1.7: AI-Assisted Literature Synthesis Matrix
**Objective**: CILO 2 & 4 (Synthesis & Citation)
- **Input**: PDF/Text of 5 key papers.
- **Process**: Use an AI agent to extract key themes, methodologies, and findings into a matrix (Table). Students then identify "conversations" or "disagreements" between these papers.
- **Output**: A thematic synthesis matrix in Markdown.
- **Learning/Insights**: Moves students from "listing" papers (X said this, Y said that) to "synthesizing" (X and Y agree on A, but disagree on B).
- **Tutor Contribution**: Dr. Wang facilitates a small group meeting to discuss how to turn a row in the matrix into a cohesive paragraph.

## Activity 1.8: Creating a "Move 2" Gap-Statement Bank
**Objective**: CILO 3 (Linguistic Features for Gaps)
- **Input**: `Writing_Assignment_Brief.md`, `Session 1 & 2` materials.
- **Process**: Students use AI to search for "gap-indicating" phrases in 10 papers and categorize them by "strength" (e.g., "little is known" vs. "previous research is flawed").
- **Output**: A personalized "Gap-Phrase Bank" for their discipline.
- **Learning/Insights**: Students build a repertoire of specific linguistic tools to justify their research niche.
- **Tutor Contribution**: Dr. Wang advises on the "nuance" and "politeness" of different gap statements to avoid sounding overly dismissive of peers.

## Activity 1.9: Citation Strategy & Voice Analysis
**Objective**: CILO 4 (Strategic Documentation)
- **Input**: A section of the student's draft with citations.
- **Process**: Use AI to classify citations as "Integral" (Author is subject) or "Non-integral" (Author in parentheses). Analyze whose "voice" is dominant in each paragraph.
- **Output**: A "Voice Map" of a draft section.
- **Learning/Insights**: Understanding how citation style shifts focus between the *researcher* and the *research findings*.
- **Tutor Contribution**: Dr. Wang reviews the balance to ensure the student's own "voice" isn't lost among the citations.

## Activity 1.10: AI Prompt Engineering for Academic Tone
**Objective**: CILO 3 (Linguistic Repertoire)
- **Input**: `tutorInfo.md` (AI partnership focus).
- **Process**: Students draft a "relaxed" version of a research finding and develop 3 different AI prompts to transform it into "High Academic Tone," "Concise Technical," and "Interdisciplinary Accessible."
- **Output**: A "Prompt Log" documenting which prompts yielded the most authentic academic results.
- **Learning/Insights**: Students learn to treat AI as a "style consultant" rather than a ghostwriter.
- **Tutor Contribution**: Dr. Wang shares his insights on "vibe coding" and AI agents to help students refine their prompts.

## Activity 1.11: Reverse Outlining of a Published Paper
**Objective**: CILO 2 (Macro-level Structure)
- **Input**: The Keller paper or a field-specific equivalent.
- **Process**: Read the paper and use AI to generate a "Reverse Outline" (one sentence summary per paragraph). Identify if the actual structure matches the intended "Rhetorical Moves."
- **Output**: A logic-map of a successful paper.
- **Learning/Insights**: Visualizing how professional writers link ideas logically at the macro level.
- **Tutor Contribution**: Dr. Wang helps identify "hidden" moves or deviations from standard models that make the paper successful.

## Activity 1.12: The "So What?" Challenge (Impact Statement)
**Objective**: CILO 2 (Establishing Importance)
- **Input**: Move 1 (Territory) draft.
- **Process**: Use AI to roleplay as a "Skeptical Reviewer" who repeatedly asks "So what?". Students must use AI to help brainstorm broader societal or technical impacts.
- **Output**: A revised "Move 1" with a strong impact statement.
- **Learning/Insights**: Learning to articulate the "significance" of research beyond narrow technical metrics.
- **Tutor Contribution**: Dr. Wang (as a non-specialist with CS interest) provides the "skeptical" perspective to test clarity.

## Activity 1.13: Visualizing Argumentative Flow
**Objective**: CILO 2 (Logical Linking)
- **Input**: Draft of the Literature Review.
- **Process**: Convert the draft into a Mermaid flowchart or a `visualSample.html` style map using AI to show how ideas lead to one another. Identify "dead ends" or "logical leaps."
- **Output**: An argumentative flowchart.
- **Learning/Insights**: Finding structural weaknesses in the narrative flow before finalizing the text.
- **Tutor Contribution**: Dr. Wang reviews the flowchart to see if the "story" makes sense to a reader.

## Activity 1.14: AI Ethics & Attribution Reflection
**Objective**: Academic Integrity (Implicit in CILOs)
- **Input**: All AI outputs generated in previous activities.
- **Process**: Write a reflection on which parts of the final assignment were AI-assisted, how the AI was used (e.g., brainstorming vs. proofreading), and how integrity was maintained.
- **Output**: An "AI Usage Declaration" and reflection.
- **Learning/Insights**: Developing a personal ethical framework for using AI in long-term PhD research.
- **Tutor Contribution**: Dr. Wang discusses the "partnership" model (Language Teacher + AI + Student) and ethical boundaries.
