| **INTRODUCTION**                                                               |
+:=========================================+:====================================+
| **Move 1 - Establishing a Territory**    | e.g. Research in \[Topic\] has      |
|                                          | gained significant attention due to |
| - Present the general topic              | \[reasons for importance\].         |
|   area/research problem.                 | (Centrality statements)             |
|                                          |                                     |
| - Highlight the importance of the        |                                     |
|   research.                              |                                     |
|                                          |                                     |
| - Synthesise the key prior research that |                                     |
|   supports the need for the current      |                                     |
|   research.                              |                                     |
+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Move 2 - Identifying a Niche**         | e.g. Despite extensive studies on   |
|                                          | \[related topic\], there remains a  |
| - Introduce an opposing                  | lack of understanding regarding     |
|   viewpoints/perspective to the current  | \[specific gap\].                   |
|   state of knowledge.                    |                                     |
|                                          |                                     |
| - Identify gaps in the existing          |                                     |
|   literature (no need to provide a       |                                     |
|   detailed literature review here).      |                                     |
|                                          |                                     |
| - Explain why addressing these gaps is   |                                     |
|   necessary.                             |                                     |
+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Move 3 - Occupying the Niche**         | e.g. This study aims to investigate |
|                                          | \[research question\], focusing on  |
| - State your research purpose or         | \[specific aspects\].               |
|   question.                              |                                     |
|                                          |                                     |
| - Outline the objectives of your         |                                     |
|   research and how it will fill the      |                                     |
|   gaps.                                  |                                     |
+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **LITERATURE REVIEW**                                                          |
+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Move 1 - Thematic Overview**           | e.g. Several studies have           |
|                                          | demonstrated that \[summary of      |
| - Provide context (e.g. defining key     | findings\].                         |
|   terms/concepts/research teams) for the |                                     |
|   literature review.                     |                                     |
|                                          |                                     |
| - Explain the purpose and scope of the   |                                     |
|   review.                                |                                     |
+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Move 2 - Critical Analysis**           | e.g. While \[Author\] (Year)        |
|                                          | provides valuable insights, their   |
| - Group the literature according to      | approach lacks \[limitations\].     |
|   common themes, paradigms, theories,    |                                     |
|   methodologies or chronological order.  |                                     |
|                                          |                                     |
| - Summarize and synthesize the existing  |                                     |
|   literature. Show connections,          |                                     |
|   relationships or contrasts among       |                                     |
|   studies (e.g. methodologies, findings, |                                     |
|   claims/arguments).                     |                                     |
|                                          |                                     |
| - Critique methodologies and findings of |                                     |
|   the previous research.                 |                                     |
+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Move 3 - Research Gaps**               | e.g. There is a clear need for      |
|                                          | research that addresses             |
| - Reiterate the gaps identified in       | \[identified gaps\].                |
|   previous studies.                      |                                     |
|                                          |                                     |
| - Emphasize the need for further         |                                     |
|   investigation.                         |                                     |
+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Move 4 - Conclusion of the Literature  | e.g. By addressing these gaps, this |
| Review**                                 | research will contribute to         |
|                                          | \[expected contributions\].         |
| - Summarize key insights and their       |                                     |

**Oral Presentation Assessment 3 -- Three-minute Thesis (3MT)
Presentation**

Date: **Session 13**

Weighting: 20%

INSTRUCTIONS:

Within **3 minutes** maximum, you need to **explain the aims, the
results, and/or the significance of your research\*** to [a
**non-specialist audience (e.g. prospective employers, grant review
panels, the public community)**]{.underline}. You should only **[use one
static PowerPoint slide]{.underline}**. The presentation should be
intelligible to laymen who have no/little knowledge of your field.
Hence, technical terms should be strictly avoided.

A key requirement of a 3MT presentation is to **simplify your research**
effectively using **strategies** such as **metaphors, similes, and daily
life examples** in order to engage the public audience. The presentation
should be **interactive** using hooks and attention-getters.

You should **upload the presentation slide** to a folder shared by the
class lecturer **at least** **two hours before the assessment**.

To prepare for your presentation, you may watch some award-winning
examples of the Three-Minute Thesis Competition organised by the
University of Queensland:
<https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/watch-3mt>

Note cards with key points may be used during the presentation; however,
reading directly from a script is not permitted and will result in a
failing grade for the assessment.

NOTE:

- You will need to evaluate two to four of your classmates'
  presentations and provide peer feedback using a peer evaluation form.
  Your lecturer will tell you about the arrangements.
