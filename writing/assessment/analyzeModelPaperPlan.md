# Plan for Analyzing Model Papers: Task Achievement Focus

## Purpose
This plan outlines a systematic approach to analyze model papers from target journals/conferences to identify features and strategies that contribute to excellent Task Achievement in academic writing. The analysis will be transformed into actionable insights and advice for writing effective introductions and literature reviews.

## Context and Framework

### Assessment Criteria (from `writing_instructions_formatted.md`)
According to the rubric, **Task Achievement** evaluates:
- Extremely clear explanation of the research background, focus and objectives
- Skilful paraphrase, synthesis and critical evaluation of the relevant literature
- Clearly delineated research gap
- Succinctly highlighted significance of the research
- Adequate and effective use of sources, proper citations & referencing

### Key Principles from Course Materials

**From Session 1 Handout:**
- The CARS model (Creating a Research Space) with three moves:
  - **Move 1 – Establishing a Territory**: Present the general topic area/research problem, highlight importance, synthesize key prior research
  - **Move 2 – Identifying a Niche**: Introduce opposing viewpoints/perspectives, identify gaps, explain why addressing gaps is necessary
  - **Move 3 – Occupying the Niche**: State research purpose/question, outline objectives and how they fill gaps

**From Session 2 Handout:**
- Literature Review moves:
  - **Move 1 – Thematic Overview**: Provide context, define key terms/concepts, explain purpose and scope
  - **Move 2 – Critical Analysis**: Group literature by themes, synthesize, show connections/contrasts, critique methodologies and findings
  - **Move 3 – Research Gaps**: Reiterate gaps, emphasize need for further investigation
  - **Move 4 – Conclusion**: Summarize key insights, set stage for research contribution

## Five Aspects for Analysis

### Aspect 1: Research Background and Centrality Statements

**What to Analyze:**
- How authors establish the general territory of their research topic
- The use of centrality statements to highlight importance
- Strategies for presenting background information clearly and concisely

**Key Questions:**
1. How do model papers begin their introductions? What opening strategies are used?
2. What linguistic features characterize effective centrality statements? (e.g., evaluative adjectives, present/present perfect tense, inversion patterns)
3. How do authors balance general background with specific research context?
4. What makes the explanation "extremely clear" versus "generally clear"?

**Excerpt Reference (Session 1, Sample 1):**
> "Organic electronics have drawn enormous attention in the past few decades owing to the ease of processing, ultralow-cost substrates, lightweight properties, thin film flexibility and tunable functionality.1 Integration of photochromic properties with organic electronics has been a tempting approach to accomplish photo-responsive multifunctional optoelectronics.2"

**Excerpt Reference (Session 1, Sample 2):**
> "A considerable amount of literature has analysed how the transition to retirement affects subjective well-being (SWB)."

**Actionable Insights to Extract:**
- Patterns in opening sentences (e.g., broad statements, statistics, literature references)
- Common phrases for establishing centrality (e.g., "has drawn enormous attention", "has been studied by many researchers")
- How to transition from general territory to specific research focus

---

### Aspect 2: Research Gap Identification and Delineation

**What to Analyze:**
- How authors identify and articulate research gaps clearly
- Strategies for moving from existing knowledge to gaps
- Language patterns used to signal limitations and gaps

**Key Questions:**
1. How do model papers transition from Move 1 (Establishing Territory) to Move 2 (Identifying Niche)?
2. What linguistic markers signal gap identification? (e.g., "However", "Despite", "has not been comprehensively investigated")
3. How do authors distinguish between different types of gaps (methodological, theoretical, empirical)?
4. What makes a gap "clearly delineated" versus "rather vague"?

**Excerpt Reference (Session 1, Sample 1):**
> "In contrast to crystalline photochromism, which has been well-studied for potential applications in light-driven molecular machines,4 thin film photochromism adopted in photo-modulated organic electronics has not been comprehensively investigated for its photochromic properties."

**Excerpt Reference (Session 1, Sample 2):**
> "To date, most research has been focused on people with straightforward work-to-retirement transitions (e.g., Damman, Henkens & Kalmijn, 2013a; Hershey & Henkens, 2014; Shultz et al., 1998) while systematically excluding people who did not participate in the labour market prior to retirement..."

**Actionable Insights to Extract:**
- Common gap-signaling phrases and their rhetorical functions
- Strategies for contrasting existing research with what is missing
- How to build a compelling case for why the gap matters

### Aspect 3: Literature Synthesis and Critical Evaluation

**What to Analyze:**
- How authors synthesize multiple sources effectively
- Strategies for grouping and organizing literature (thematic, chronological, methodological)
- Use of reporting verbs and evaluative language to show critical stance
- Techniques for showing connections, relationships, and contrasts among studies

**Key Questions:**
1. How do model papers organize their literature review sections? (thematic, chronological, methodological approaches)
2. What reporting verbs are used and how do they convey the writer's stance?
3. How do authors show synthesis (combining multiple sources) versus simple summary?
4. What evaluative language is used to critique methodologies and findings?
5. How do authors demonstrate "skilful" synthesis versus "limited attempt"?

**Excerpt Reference (Session 2, Example 2 - Journal of Marketing):**
> "Studies in many fields have concluded that beauty has a premium and ugliness is penalized (Eagly et al. 1991; Langlois et al. 2000). According to evolutionary psychology (e.g., Magro 1999), an attractive face indicates good health and prospect for survival and reproduction. Beauty is also correlated with perceived intelligence and social skills (Eagly et al. 1991; Hamermesh 2011)."

**Excerpt Reference (Session 1, Sample 1):**
> "Among the photochromic compounds,5 diarylethenes have been regarded as one of the most attractive photochromic compounds given their promising thermal irreversibility, fatigue resistance and ability to carry out solid state photo-chromism. Various photochromic diarylethenes with different photo-controlled functions have been reported. However, most of the research has been confined to carrying out modifications of pendant aryl units attached to the perfluorocyclopentene backbone."

**Actionable Insights to Extract:**
- Patterns in synthesizing multiple sources in single paragraphs
- Use of reporting verbs to show critical evaluation (tentative, neutral, strong)
- Strategies for showing relationships between studies (similarities, differences, contradictions)
- Language for critiquing methodologies and findings

### Aspect 4: Research Objectives and Significance

**What to Analyze:**
- How authors state research purpose and objectives clearly
- Strategies for connecting objectives to identified gaps
- Techniques for highlighting research significance and potential contributions
- How authors "occupy the niche" effectively

**Key Questions:**
1. How do model papers present their research objectives? (explicit statements, research questions, hypotheses)
2. How do authors connect their objectives to the gaps identified?
3. What language is used to highlight significance and contributions?
4. How do authors balance modesty with confidence in presenting their work?
5. What makes significance "succinctly highlighted" versus "clearly stated"?

**Excerpt Reference (Session 1, Sample 1):**
> "With our continuous interest in designing various photochromic materials,7-9,12,14,18 we envisioned that the direct attachment of two thienyl rings onto the phosphole ring would offer a strategy to optimize the photochromic performance of the system... The present work provides important insights and guiding principles into the molecular design of photochromic diarylethene systems with excellent thermal irreversibility and fatigue resistance."

**Excerpt Reference (Session 1, Sample 2):**
> "In the current study, we address these gaps in the literature by examining the relationship between five distinct pathways to retirement and patterns of SWB from pre-to post-retirement. Our conceptualization of pathways to retirement considers both the duration and succession of labour market statuses before retirement. As a result, we are better able to differentiate the consequences of (non-)employment histories before retirement on SWB in later life relative to previous studies."

**Actionable Insights to Extract:**
- Common phrases for stating research objectives and purpose
- Strategies for linking objectives to gaps
- Language patterns for highlighting contributions (e.g., "provides important insights", "addresses these gaps", "better able to differentiate")
- How to balance specificity with scope

### Aspect 5: Source Integration, Citation, and Referencing

**What to Analyze:**
- Patterns in citation frequency and distribution
- Use of author-prominent vs. information-prominent citation approaches
- Strategies for integrating citations smoothly into text
- Citation style conventions and accuracy
- Balance between adequate citation and over/under-citing

**Key Questions:**
1. How frequently are sources cited in model papers? (per paragraph, per section)
2. Which citation approach is used more (author-prominent or information-prominent)?
3. How do authors integrate multiple citations in single sentences?
4. How are citations used to support different rhetorical moves?
5. What makes citation use "adequate and effective" versus "ineffective"?

**Excerpt Reference (Session 1, Sample 2):**
> "Older research has reported contradictory results, with no clear findings as to whether retirement had a positive, negative or no general effect on SWB (e.g., Gall et al., 1997; Isaksson & Johansson, 2000; Richardson and Kilty, 1991; Warr et al., 2004). Evidence from more recent studies has highlighted that trajectories of SWB in the post-retirement phase of life show no single universal pattern. Instead, SWB post-retirement depends on a number of protective- and risk-factors that vary across social groups and individuals (e.g., Bender, 2012; Calvo et al., 2009; Pinquart and Schindler, 2007; van Solinge and Henkens, 2005, 2007, 2008; Wang, 2007; Wetzel et al., 2016)."

**Excerpt Reference (Session 2, Example 2):**
> "Faces are known to bias decisions (Wheeler and Petty 2001). We form first impressions of others and make judgments about their social traits almost instantaneously on the basis of face perceptions (Samper, Yang, and Daniels 2018; Todorov et al. 2005; Willis and Todorov 2006)."

**Actionable Insights to Extract:**
- Patterns in citation density across different sections
- Strategies for citing multiple sources (e.g., chronological grouping, thematic grouping)
- When to use author-prominent vs. information-prominent approaches
- Techniques for avoiding citation overload while maintaining credibility
- Common citation errors to avoid
