a priority for this course is to ensure all students complete all the assessment tasks and everybody will pass this course with an S (satisfactory)

so let's work on this writing task that account for 40% of the final grade

today is 25 Jan
the deadline is 15 Mar; let's aim to get it done by the end of Feb

stage 1 is to decide how a student can improve one's writing in this course; name three ways this improvment can be achieved
we need some input from students

then we'll also decide which topic to work on; the draft will be sent to TurnItIn - so we may not want to write about new ideas that are not yet published

we should review the rubrics and assess what counts as good writing in this assessmnet
now we also need to consider what counts as good writing in your research community; what are the expectations of your journals or target conferences

I think we need to customise this rubrics a bit

how can we figure this out

I think the starting point is the rubrics from the course team PhDagentSpring2026/writing/assessment/writing_instructions_formatted.md

then there should be some input from you
