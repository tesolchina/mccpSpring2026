| INTRODUCTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Move 1 - Establishing a Territory * Present the general topic area/research problem.* Highlight the importance of the research.* Synthesise the key prior research that supports the need for the current research.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Move 2 - Identifying a Niche * Introduce an opposing viewpoints/perspective to the current state of knowledge.* Identify gaps in the existing literature (no need to provide a detailed literature review here).* Explain why addressing these gaps is necessary.                                                                                                       |
| Move 3 - Occupying the Niche * State your research purpose or question.* Outline the objectives of your research and how it will fill the gaps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| LITERATURE REVIEW                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Move 1 - Thematic Overview * Provide context (e.g. defining key terms/concepts/research teams) for the literature review.* Explain the purpose and scope of the review.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Move 2 - Critical Analysis * Group the literature according to common themes, paradigms, theories, methodologies or chronological order.* Summarize and synthesize the existing literature. Show connections, relationships or contrasts among studies (e.g. methodologies, findings, claims/arguments).* Critique methodologies and findings of the previous research. |
| Move 3 - Research Gaps * Reiterate the gaps identified in previous studies.* Emphasize the need for further investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Move 4 - Conclusion of the Literature Review * Summarize key insights and their implications.* Set the stage for your research contribution. Emphasize the significance of the literature in relation to your research question.                                                                                                                                        |
