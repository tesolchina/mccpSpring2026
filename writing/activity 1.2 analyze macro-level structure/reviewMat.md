given the focus on macro level structure, review writing/materials/Session 1_Handout_STUDENT version_LLM_Formatted.md writing/materials/Session 2_Handout_STUDENT Version_LLM_Formatted.md 

our main concern is how to organize a research article at macro level, i.e. how to select different ideas and contents to present in each sections and sub-sections and how these sections and sub-sections should be linked logically 

Create a new note macroNotes.md taking into account the handout and materials above and write new and concise notes with actionable insights on how to organize a paper; we need advice that is useful for writing/materials/Writing_Assignment_Brief.md

we also need tips and instructions for analyzing and annotating published papers to further enrich our knowledge on this issue in specific fields and sub-fields 

output: create the note sampleNotes.md in the same folder
