# Macro-Level Paper Organization: Actionable Insights for Introduction & Literature Review

## Core Principle: Hourglass Model
**General → Specific → General** flow ensures logical progression:
- **Introduction**: Broad field context → Specific research gap → Targeted contribution
- **Literature Review**: General overview → Critical analysis → Specific gaps → Synthesis

## Introduction Structure (CARS Model - 3 Moves)

### Move 1: Establishing a Territory (General)
**Purpose**: Claim centrality and importance of your research area
**Actionable Steps**:
1. Start with 1-2 centrality statements using evaluative adjectives
2. Use present/present perfect tense: "Research in [topic] has gained significant attention due to..."
3. Synthesize key prior research (not detailed literature review)
4. Include evidence of growing awareness/importance

**Common Phrases**:
- "Recently, there has been growing interest in..."
- "[Topic] has become increasingly important because..."
- "The relationship between [X] and [Y] has been widely studied..."

### Move 2: Establishing a Niche (Specific)
**Purpose**: Identify gaps, limitations, or underexplored areas
**Actionable Steps**:
1. Present opposing viewpoints or current consensus
2. Highlight specific limitations of existing research
3. Use gap-identifying language: "despite," "however," "while"
4. Connect gaps to broader consequences

**Common Phrases**:
- "Despite extensive studies on [topic], there remains a lack of understanding regarding..."
- "While previous research has focused on [X], little attention has been paid to [Y]..."
- "However, these studies have largely overlooked..."

### Move 3: Occupying the Niche (Solution)
**Purpose**: Position your research as the solution
**Actionable Steps**:
1. State precise research aims/questions/objectives
2. Outline how your study addresses identified gaps
3. Provide brief summary of expected findings
4. Indicate paper structure/organization

**Common Phrases**:
- "This study aims to investigate [question] by examining..."
- "The present research addresses this gap by..."
- "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows..."

## Literature Review Structure (4 Moves)

### Move 1: Thematic Overview
**Purpose**: Provide context and scope for the review
**Actionable Steps**:
1. Define key terms and concepts
2. Explain review purpose and scope
3. Present general findings/trends
4. Avoid detailed critique at this stage

**Common Phrases**:
- "Several studies have demonstrated that..."
- "Research in this area has primarily focused on..."
- "The concept of [term] refers to..."

### Move 2: Critical Analysis
**Purpose**: Evaluate existing research and show relationships
**Actionable Steps**:
1. Group literature by themes/methods/chronology
2. Summarize and synthesize findings
3. Critique methodologies and findings
4. Show connections, contrasts, and relationships
5. Use evaluation language: "effective," "limited," "promising"

**Common Phrases**:
- "While [Author] provides valuable insights, their approach lacks..."
- "In contrast to [previous work], [current study] demonstrates..."
- "These findings are consistent with [related research]..."

### Move 3: Research Gaps
**Purpose**: Highlight specific areas needing further investigation
**Actionable Steps**:
1. Reiterate gaps identified in literature
2. Emphasize need for additional research
3. Connect gaps to broader implications
4. Use future-oriented language

**Common Phrases**:
- "There is a clear need for research that addresses..."
- "Future studies should explore..."
- "Despite these advances, several questions remain unanswered..."

### Move 4: Conclusion of Literature Review
**Purpose**: Synthesize insights and set up your contribution
**Actionable Steps**:
1. Summarize key insights and implications
2. Set stage for your research contribution
3. Link back to your research questions
4. Emphasize significance of addressing gaps

**Common Phrases**:
- "Taken together, these studies suggest that..."
- "By addressing these gaps, this research will contribute to..."
- "Building on this literature, the present study..."

## Cross-Section Integration
**Introduction → Literature Review Flow**:
- Introduction Move 2 gaps → Literature Review Move 3 gaps
- Introduction Move 3 objectives → Literature Review Move 4 contributions
- Ensure research questions appear in both sections

## Linguistic Features for Cohesion
- **Transitions**: "Building on this work," "In contrast," "Furthermore"
- **Nominalization**: Turn processes into nouns for concise academic style
- **Citation Integration**: Use author-date system consistently
- **Hedging**: "Suggests," "may indicate," "appears to" for academic caution

## Discipline-Specific Considerations
- **STEM fields**: More methodological critique, technical precision
- **Social Sciences**: Greater emphasis on theoretical frameworks and contextual factors
- **Humanities**: Focus on conceptual debates and interpretive analysis

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Each move clearly identifiable and purposeful
- [ ] Logical flow between moves and sections
- [ ] Balance between summary and critical analysis
- [ ] Clear research niche established and occupied
- [ ] Citations support all key claims
- [ ] Word count appropriate (1000-1500 words total)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Over-summarizing**: Don't just list studies; analyze and synthesize
- **Weak gap identification**: Be specific about what exactly is missing
- **Poor transitions**: Ensure each move connects logically to the next
- **Unclear contribution**: Explicitly state how your work advances the field
