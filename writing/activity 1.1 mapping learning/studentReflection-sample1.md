My strength and weaknesses as an academic writer

**Strengths:**
- **Logical Flow:** Coming from a CS background, I find it easy to structure my writing logically, similar to how I’d architect a system or write an algorithm. I can clearly explain complex technical processes step-by-step.
- **Clarity in Technical Description:** I am good at describing "how" things work—parameters, experimental setups, and mathematical formulations are usually my strongest sections.
- **Tooling Proficiency:** I’m very comfortable with LaTeX and BibTeX, which helps me manage citations and formatting efficiently without it being a distraction.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Synthesizing the "So What?":** I struggle with the literature review. I tend to summarize papers one-by-one rather than synthesizing them to highlight a specific research gap.
- **Over-reliance on Jargon:** I often assume the reader knows every acronym and niche concept. I find it hard to write for a broader academic audience outside my specific sub-field.
- **Passive Voice & Wordiness:** My drafts are often cluttered with passive voice and "filler" phrases, making the prose feel dense and harder to read than it should be.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Narrative Building:** I want to learn how to tell a "story" with my research, particularly in the Introduction and Discussion sections, rather than just presenting a list of findings.
- **Abstract Writing:** I need to get better at condensing a 10-page paper into a 200-word abstract that actually sells the core contribution.
- **Critically Evaluating Literature:** Instead of just reporting what others did, I want to develop a more critical "voice" to explain *why* previous methods might be insufficient for my problem.
