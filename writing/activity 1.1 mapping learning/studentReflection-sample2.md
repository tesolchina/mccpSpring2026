# Research Student Writing Reflection

**Field:** Computer Science (Focus: Machine Learning for Healthcare)
**Role:** Novice Research Student (1st Year)

### Strengths
- **Technical Precision:** I am comfortable describing algorithms, mathematical proofs, and system architectures using precise terminology. I can explain the "how" of my code very clearly.
- **Data Visualization:** I can create complex graphs and tables in LaTeX/Matplotlib that convey results effectively, and I am good at writing concise captions for these figures.
- **Logical Flow:** My coding background helps me structure papers with a logical sequence, following a standard IMRaD format without getting lost in the narrative.

### Weaknesses
- **The "So What?" Factor:** I struggle to articulate the broader significance of my research. I often get bogged down in technical details and fail to explain why a 2% improvement in model accuracy matters to the medical field.
- **Literature Synthesis:** Instead of critically evaluating sources, I tend to write "list-like" literature reviews (e.g., "X did this, Y did that"). I find it hard to find themes or gaps across different papers.
- **Academic Hedge/Tone:** I often sound too "absolute" in my claims. I haven't mastered the art of using academic hedging (e.g., "it suggests," "may indicate") and my sentences sometimes feel more like documentation than a scholarly argument.

### Areas for Improvement
- **Abstract & Intro Writing:** Specifically, I want to learn how to write a compelling "hook" and a problem statement that resonates with both CS experts and healthcare practitioners.
- **Argumentative Cohesion:** I need to work on transition phrases between paragraphs so the paper doesn't feel like a collection of disjointed technical notes.
- **Paraphrasing Complex Concepts:** Improving my ability to summarize high-level theoretical concepts from other papers without over-relying on direct quotes or slipping into plagiarism.
