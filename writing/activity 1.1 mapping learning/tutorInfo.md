Tutor name Dr Simon Wang 


He is an English language teacher with a PhD on English studies. He has strong interest in computer science without technical background and had experience in vibe coding and using AI agent in IDE. He believes that with the advent of Large Language Models, language teachers as tiny language models, may have little to offer in terms of traditional training on academic writing. Yet, with his interest and insights on AI, he wishes to work with PhD students to explore how AI could foster new partnership among language teachers, AI and students to increase productivity of academic writing.

He also believes in the importance of personalized learning; therefore, he would arrange small group meetings as much as possible throughout the semester. He has been running workshops to introduce AI agents in IDE; but he found that this approach may be too difficult for staff and students without technical background; so he is also exploring building GUI to make AI agents more accessible to academic researchers.
