# Process Log for YFZhang Literature Analysis

## Task Overview
- Analyze two PDF papers in the YFZhang folder
- Try to find HTML versions first
- If not available, convert PDFs to markdown
- Generate analysis reports similar to writing/activity 1.2 analyze macro-level structure

## Steps Completed

### Step 1: Initial Setup
- [x] Reviewed retrieveAnalyze.md task description
- [x] Examined sample report format (KellerInsights.md)
- [x] Identified two PDFs:
  - Learning_with_Mixture_of_ICLR_2024_IMP.pdf
  - Provable Discriminative Hyperspherical Embedding_AAAI_2025_IMP.pdf

### Step 2: HTML Search (Completed)
- [x] Searched for HTML versions of papers online
- [x] Results: HTML versions not readily available
- [x] Decision: Proceed with PDF to markdown conversion

### Step 3: PDF Conversion (Completed)
- [x] Converted PDFs to text format using pdftotext
- [x] Created text files:
  - Learning_with_Mixture_of_ICLR_2024_IMP.txt (3142 lines)
  - Provable Discriminative Hyperspherical Embedding_AAAI_2025_IMP.txt (1028 lines)
- [x] Verified text extraction quality - successful

### Step 4: Analysis (Completed)
- [x] Analyzed first paper structure (PALM - ICLR 2024)
  - Paper: Learning with Mixture of Prototypes for Out-of-Distribution Detection
  - Structure: Introduction → Related Work → Method → Experiments → Conclusion
  - Key contributions: Mixture of prototypes, MLE loss, prototype contrastive loss
- [x] Generated insights report for first paper: PALMInsights.md
- [x] Analyzed second paper structure (DHE - AAAI 2025)
  - Paper: Provable Discriminative Hyperspherical Embedding for Out-of-Distribution Detection
  - Structure: Introduction → Theoretical Implication → Method → Experiments → Discussion → Conclusion
  - Key contributions: Theoretical guarantees, angular spread loss, pre-computation efficiency
- [x] Generated insights report for second paper: DHEInsights.md

### Step 5: Documentation (Completed)
- [x] Created process.log documenting all steps
- [x] Finalized process.log with completion status

### Step 6: HTML Visualization Files (Completed)
- [x] Created PALMVisualization.html for PALM paper
- [x] Created DHEVisualization.html for DHE paper
- [x] HTML files follow visualSample.html template structure
- [x] HTML files include key sections, moves, excerpts, and analysis

## Summary
- Successfully converted 2 PDFs to text format
- Generated 2 comprehensive insights reports following the format of writing/activity 1.2 analyze macro-level structure/KellerInsights.md
- Reports include extensive excerpts from original papers as requested
- Both reports analyze macro-level structure, section-by-section analysis, cross-disciplinary comparison, and imitation opportunities
