# Process Log for JXJiang Literature Analysis

## Task Overview
- Analyze two PDF papers in the JXJiang folder
- Try to find HTML versions first
- If not available, convert PDFs to markdown
- Generate analysis reports similar to writing/activity 1.2 analyze macro-level structure
- Create HTML visualizations and insights reports with extensive excerpts from original papers

## Steps Completed

### Step 1: Initial Setup
- [x] Reviewed retrieveAnalyze.md task description
- [x] Examined sample report formats (KellerInsights.md, visualSample.html)
- [x] Identified two PDFs:
  - CHASE-SQL MULTI-PATH REASONING AND PREFERENCE OPTIMIZED CANDIDATE SELECTION IN TEXTTO-SQL.pdf
  - OpenSearch-SQL Enhancing Text-to-SQL with Dynamic Few-shot and Consistency Alignment.pdf

### Step 2: HTML Search (Completed)
- [x] Searched for HTML versions of papers online
- [x] Paper 1: "CHASE-SQL MULTI-PATH REASONING AND PREFERENCE OPTIMIZED CANDIDATE SELECTION IN TEXTTO-SQL" - HTML version not readily available
- [x] Paper 2: "OpenSearch-SQL Enhancing Text-to-SQL with Dynamic Few-shot and Consistency Alignment" - HTML version not readily available
- [x] Decision: Proceed with PDF to markdown conversion

### Step 3: PDF Conversion (Completed)
- [x] Created convert_pdf_to_md.py script based on YJYin/convert_pdf_to_md.py
- [x] Converted PDFs to markdown format using PyMuPDF (pymupdf)
- [x] Created markdown files:
  - CHASE-SQL MULTI-PATH REASONING AND PREFERENCE OPTIMIZED CANDIDATE SELECTION IN TEXTTO-SQL.md (1857 lines)
  - OpenSearch-SQL Enhancing Text-to-SQL with Dynamic Few-shot and Consistency Alignment.md (1692 lines)
- [x] Verified text extraction quality - successful

### Step 4: Analysis (Completed)
- [x] Analyzed first paper structure (CHASE-SQL - ICLR 2025)
  - Paper: CHASE-SQL: MULTI-PATH REASONING AND PREFERENCE OPTIMIZED CANDIDATE SELECTION IN TEXT-TO-SQL
  - Authors: Pourreza et al. (2025)
  - Structure: Introduction → Methods (2.1 Overall Framework, 2.2 Value Retrieval, 2.3 Multi-Path Candidate Generation, 2.4 Query Fixer, 2.5 Selection Agent) → Experiments (3.1 Generator and Selection Performance, 3.2 Ablation Studies) → Conclusion
  - Key contributions: Three candidate generation methods (Divide-and-Conquer CoT, Query Plan CoT, Online Synthetic Example Generation), selection agent with pairwise comparison
  - Performance: 73.01% EX (dev), 73.0% EX (test) on BIRD, 87.6% on Spider
- [x] Generated insights report for first paper: CHASE-SQL_Insights.md
- [x] Analyzed second paper structure (OpenSearch-SQL)
  - Paper: OpenSearch-SQL: Enhancing Text-to-SQL with Dynamic Few-shot and Consistency Alignment
  - Authors: Xie et al. (2025)
  - Structure: Introduction → Preliminary (2.1 Large Language Models, 2.2 Text-to-SQL, 2.3 Hallucination) → Methodology (3.1 Alignments, 3.2 Self-Taught Fewshot, 3.3-3.6 Framework Components, 3.7 Algorithm, 3.8 Optimization) → Experiments → Related Work → Conclusion
  - Key contributions: Consistency alignment mechanism, self-taught dynamic few-shot, SQL-Like intermediate language, four-stage framework (Preprocessing, Extraction, Generation, Refinement)
  - Performance: 69.3% EX (dev), 72.28% EX (test), 69.36% R-VES on BIRD, all ranking first
- [x] Generated insights report for second paper: OpenSearch-SQL_Insights.md

### Step 5: HTML Visualization Files (Completed)
- [x] Created CHASE-SQL_Visualization.html for CHASE-SQL paper
- [x] Created OpenSearch-SQL_Visualization.html for OpenSearch-SQL paper
- [x] HTML files follow visualSample.html template structure
- [x] HTML files include key sections, moves, excerpts, and analysis
- [x] HTML files include cross-disciplinary comparison tables and imitation frameworks

### Step 6: Documentation (Completed)
- [x] Created process.log documenting all steps
- [x] Finalized process.log with completion status

## Summary
- Successfully converted 2 PDFs to markdown format
- Generated 2 comprehensive insights reports following the format of writing/activity 1.2 analyze macro-level structure/KellerInsights.md
- Reports include extensive excerpts from original papers as requested (13+ excerpts per paper)
- Both reports analyze macro-level structure, section-by-section analysis, cross-disciplinary comparison, and imitation opportunities
- Generated 2 HTML visualization files following the format of writing/activity 1.2 analyze macro-level structure/visualSample.html
- HTML files include interactive visualizations of paper structure with key excerpts and analysis
- All files created: CHASE-SQL_Insights.md, CHASE-SQL_Visualization.html, OpenSearch-SQL_Insights.md, OpenSearch-SQL_Visualization.html, process.log
