\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}
\vspace{-0.7ex}
Some of the limitations of the \OurMODEL~ are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em   
    \item Currently our work is focused on compressing prompts that may be reformulated into structured elements, \emph{i.e.,} knowledge graph triplets $(s,r,o)$. We consider its generalization to text segments that may not be organized as graph triplets as a future research direction.
    \item The performance of~\OurMODEL{} relies on the quality of the knowledge graph constructed. We use OpenIE toolkit as our primary graph construction tool. The errors in the graph are propagated in the compressed prompt and may impact the end utility of the compressed prompt. 
\end{enumerate}
