In this work, we proposed~\OurMODEL{} that leverages graph 
structures to infer key information in the prompt in order 
to come up with a compressed prompt.
Experimental evaluation showed that~\OurMODEL{} outperforms the 
existing research on by a significant margin.
Moreover,~\OurMODEL{} addressed a key limitation of existing
prompt compression approaches, \emph{i.e.,} the compressed prompts 
are easy to read and understand for end-readers.
