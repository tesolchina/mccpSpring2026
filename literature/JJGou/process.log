## Step 2: Search for HTML versions online
✓ Searched for HTML versions online
✗ No HTML versions found on arxiv, ACM, or IEEE databases
Decision: Proceed with PDF to markdown conversion

## Step 3: Convert PDFs to Markdown
✓ Copied convert_pdf_to_md.py script from JXJiang folder
✓ Successfully converted App-Bmao.pdf to App-Bmao.md
✓ Successfully converted AStar-Bmao.pdf to AStar-Bmao.md

## Step 4: Analyze papers and generate reports
✓ Analyzed App-BMao paper structure and content
✓ Analyzed AStar-BMao paper structure and content
✓ Created AppBMaoInsights.md with comprehensive macro-level analysis
✓ Created AStarBMaoInsights.md with comprehensive macro-level analysis
✓ Created AppBMaoVisualization.html for interactive visualization
✓ Created AStarBMaoVisualization.html for interactive visualization

## Summary of Analysis

### App-BMao Paper (SIGMOD 2025)
**Title**: Graph Edit Distance Estimation: A New Heuristic and A Holistic Evaluation of Learning-based Methods
**Structure**: Extended IMRaD with comprehensive survey component (~24 pages)
**Key Features**:
- Dual contribution: Survey + new heuristic algorithm
- Comprehensive taxonomy: Interpretable vs. non-interpretable GED prediction
- Framework identification: Three-module pattern across learning-based methods
- Challenges conventional wisdom: Heuristic outperforms deep learning methods
- Cross-community synthesis: Covers DB, ML, IR, CV fields

### AStar-BMao Paper (IEEE Transactions)
**Title**: Accelerating Graph Similarity Search via Efficient GED Computation
**Structure**: Classic IMRaD with two-stage refinement (~15 pages)
**Key Features**:
- Incremental innovation: Improves state-of-the-art AStar-LSa
- Two-stage solution: lbBMa (ideal) → lbBMao (practical)
- Explicit trade-off discussion: Tightness vs. efficiency
- Memory-focused: Addresses scalability limitations
- Formal guarantees: Correctness and tightness proofs

### Relationship Between Papers
- AStar-BMao: Proposes efficient exact GED computation algorithm
- App-BMao: Adapts AStar-BMao for GED estimation (heuristic version)
- Both papers share author Lijun Chang
- Complementary contributions: Exact computation vs. estimation landscape
