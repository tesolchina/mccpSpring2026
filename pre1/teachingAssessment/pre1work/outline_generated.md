## Opening (~1 minute)

### Hook
Imagine you're preparing for an important academic presentation, and you're stuck on finding the right phrases. You know what you want to say, but the words just don't sound academic enough. Now imagine having an AI assistant like ChatGPT to help you. But here's the question: Should that AI guide you step-by-step, or should you explore freely? That's exactly what this study investigated—and the answer might surprise you.

### Brief Context
This research comes from the field of English for Academic Purposes—or EAP for short—which focuses on helping students develop the language skills needed for university study. Specifically, it looks at how artificial intelligence tools can support students learning academic collocations—those natural-sounding word combinations like "key findings" or "significant impact" that make your academic speech sound more fluent and professional.

### Transition Statement
Today, I'll take you through this fascinating study that challenges our assumptions about how much guidance learners actually need when using AI tools for language learning. Let's start by understanding what problem the researchers were trying to solve.

**Presenter notes:**
- **Content/Structure:** Begin with a relatable scenario that connects to students' experience. Avoid using technical terms in the hook.
- **Delivery:** Make eye contact with the audience during the question. Pause after "might surprise you" for effect.
- **Visual Aids:** Title slide with an engaging image of a student working with technology, or a simple visualization of AI-human interaction.
- **Language:** Use accessible, conversational tone to draw in non-specialist audience. Signal the structure clearly: "Today, I'll take you through..."

## Section 1: Introduction to the Article (~1.5 minutes)

### What is the research about?
This study investigates how university students learn academic spoken collocations—those are word combinations that frequently appear together in academic contexts. Think of phrases like "further research," "preliminary findings," or "theoretical framework." These aren't just random word pairings; they're the building blocks of fluent academic communication.

The researchers wanted to know: When students use ChatGPT to improve their academic speaking skills, does it help more if they follow structured, guided tasks, or if they explore and interact freely with the AI?

### What gap or problem does it address?
Here's the problem: Even advanced English learners struggle with collocation use. They might understand individual words perfectly but still sound awkward because they don't use the natural combinations that native speakers rely on. For example, a learner might say "big findings" instead of "significant findings," or "do research" instead of "conduct research."

Traditional teaching methods haven't been particularly effective at improving collocation use, and while AI tools like ChatGPT have become incredibly popular, we don't actually know the best way to integrate them into language learning. Should teachers create detailed, step-by-step activities? Or should students be given more freedom to explore?

### Research Question and Objectives
The study asked two main questions:
1. Does guided use of ChatGPT—with structured activities and prompts—help students learn academic collocations better than unguided, exploratory interaction?
2. How do AI-assisted tasks compare to traditional teaching methods that don't use AI at all?

**Presenter notes:**
- **Content/Structure:** Use everyday examples to explain what collocations are. Avoid jargon like "lexical competence" or "formulaic sequences." Use the transition: "Here's the problem..."
- **Delivery:** Emphasize the contrast between "guided" and "unguided" clearly. Use hand gestures to show the two different approaches.
- **Visual Aids:** 
  - Slide 1: Examples of academic collocations with correct vs. incorrect usage (visual comparison)
  - Slide 2: Two research questions clearly displayed
- **Language:** "Think of phrases like..." (providing examples); "Here's the problem..." (signaling the gap); "The study asked two main questions..." (organizing structure)

## Section 2: Key Findings (~2 minutes)

### Finding 1: Unguided AI interaction was more effective
Here's where the results get interesting—and unexpected. The researchers found that students who used ChatGPT freely, without structured guidance, actually used academic collocations more frequently and more accurately than those who followed step-by-step activities.

The unguided group—students who simply had open conversations with ChatGPT about their academic tasks—showed the strongest performance. They experimented more with language, noticed useful expressions naturally, and incorporated them into their own work.

### Finding 2: Both AI groups outperformed the non-AI control
However, both AI groups—whether guided or unguided—performed significantly better than the control group who learned without any AI support. Students working with ChatGPT produced richer, more varied academic language compared to those using traditional resources like textbooks and online searches.

The data showed that learners in the AI conditions used roughly 60 different academic collocations from the specialized list, while the control group used far fewer and with less accuracy.

### Finding 3: Gains developed over time but remained modest
The study tracked students over ten weeks with multiple tests. While the AI users showed consistent improvement, the overall gains weren't dramatic. This tells us something important: learning collocations takes time and repeated practice. Even with powerful AI tools, there are no shortcuts to developing natural-sounding academic language.

**Presenter notes:**
- **Content/Structure:** Present findings in order of importance. Use specific evidence: "60 different academic collocations," "ten weeks," "two groups outperformed." Use signaling: "Here's where the results get interesting..."
- **Delivery:** Show surprise when presenting Finding 1 to engage audience. Pause after "unexpected" to let it sink in. For Finding 2, emphasize "both AI groups" to show this is an important pattern.
- **Visual Aids:**
  - Slide 1: Simple bar graph comparing accuracy/frequency across three groups
  - Slide 2: Timeline showing the 10-week study period with test points
  - Include Figure 2 from the paper (collocation frequency across time by group)
- **Language:** "The findings reveal..." "Our data indicates..." "The analysis demonstrates..." (academic signaling phrases from Session 4 materials)

## Section 3: Significance of the Research (~1.5 minutes)

### Why these findings matter
This research matters for several important reasons. First, it challenges a widespread assumption in education: that more structure and guidance always leads to better learning. For upper-intermediate learners working on familiar tasks, freedom to explore might actually be more beneficial than detailed scaffolding.

### Contribution to the field
The study makes a significant contribution to our understanding of AI in education. While there's been lots of discussion about whether AI will revolutionize learning, this research provides actual evidence about *how* AI tools should be used. It shows that the way we design learning tasks with AI is just as important as using AI itself.

The researchers developed and used a specialized list of academic spoken collocations—the Academic Spoken Collocation List or ASCL—which focuses specifically on spoken academic language rather than written texts. This is important because academic presentations are unique: students often prepare them in writing but deliver them orally, so they need collocations that work in both modes.

### Broader implications
Beyond language learning, this research has broader implications for education in the age of AI. As AI tools become more common in classrooms, teachers need evidence-based guidance about task design. Should they create detailed worksheets and structured prompts, or give students freedom to experiment? This study suggests the answer depends on learner proficiency and task familiarity—there's no one-size-fits-all approach.

The findings also speak to concerns about learner autonomy. Rather than making students dependent on AI, open-ended interaction can actually encourage them to notice language patterns, make choices, and take ownership of their learning.

**Presenter notes:**
- **Content/Structure:** Connect to broader educational concerns that the audience can relate to: autonomy, AI in education, task design. Use transitional phrase: "Beyond language learning..."
- **Delivery:** Emphasize "how" when discussing the study's contribution. Make eye contact when discussing broader implications to connect with audience concerns about AI.
- **Visual Aids:**
  - Slide 1: Visual showing the spectrum from "Highly Structured" to "Open-Ended" with optimal zone for different learners
  - Slide 2: Key takeaway box highlighting: "Task design matters as much as AI itself"
- **Language:** "This research contributes to the field by..." "The implications of these findings suggest that..." "This is particularly important because..."

## Section 4: Impact on My Own Research (~1.5 minutes)

### Influence on research design
This article has profoundly influenced how I think about my own research design. If I were to conduct a similar study, I would carefully consider the learner proficiency level when deciding how much structure to provide. The authors' decision to compare three conditions—guided AI, unguided AI, and non-AI—demonstrates the importance of including proper control groups rather than simply assuming technology improves learning.

I've also learned the value of combining quantitative and qualitative methods. The researchers used sophisticated statistical models (linear mixed-effects models) to account for individual learner differences while tracking group patterns over time. This mixed-methods approach provides more reliable insights than either method alone would offer.

### Writing skills learned from this article
From a writing perspective, this article exemplifies several excellent scholarly practices that I aim to incorporate in my own work.

**First, transparent limitation discussion:** The authors include a thorough limitations section, openly acknowledging that their sample was relatively small and that they analyzed written outputs rather than actual spoken performance. This scholarly honesty strengthens rather than weakens the paper—it shows intellectual integrity and helps readers interpret the findings appropriately.

**Second, comprehensive literature integration:** The literature review doesn't just list previous studies; it synthesizes them to build a clear argument about the research gap. The authors move systematically from general concepts (collocations in EAP) to specific issues (AI-assisted learning) to their particular focus (guided vs. unguided tasks). This creates a logical narrative that justifies the research questions.

**Third, accessibility despite complexity:** Despite dealing with sophisticated statistical analyses and specialized linguistic concepts, the authors maintain clarity throughout. They explain key terms when first introduced, use examples to illustrate abstract concepts, and structure the paper with clear signposting. For instance, they explicitly state their two research questions and return to them in the discussion.

**Fourth, connection to broader debates:** The authors situate their work within larger conversations about technology in education, learner autonomy, and pedagogical change. This elevates the paper from a narrow technical study to a contribution to broader scholarly and practical discussions.

**Presenter notes:**
- **Content/Structure:** Be specific and personal. Show genuine reflection by identifying concrete elements: limitation discussion, literature integration, etc. Provide convincing evidence from the article (specific examples).
- **Delivery:** Use first-person language ("I've learned," "I would") to make this section personal. Show enthusiasm for the writing strategies you've identified.
- **Visual Aids:**
  - Slide 1: "What I've Learned" with two columns: "Research Design Lessons" and "Writing Strategies"
  - Slide 2: Pull quotes from the paper showing examples of good writing (e.g., from limitations section)
- **Language:** "This article has profoundly influenced..." "From a writing perspective..." "This exemplifies..." "I aim to incorporate..." (showing personal engagement and critical reflection)

## Closing (~0.5 minutes)

### Summary of key takeaway
To sum up, this study reveals something counterintuitive yet valuable: when it comes to using AI for language learning, more guidance isn't always better. For proficient learners working on familiar academic tasks, the freedom to explore and experiment with ChatGPT led to richer collocation use than following structured steps. However, both approaches outperformed traditional non-AI instruction, highlighting AI's potential in language education—when designed thoughtfully.

The bigger lesson here is about task design in the age of AI: it's not just about using the technology, but about understanding how, when, and for whom different approaches work best.

### Closing statement
Thank you for your attention. I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about the study, the findings, or the broader implications for AI in education.

**Presenter notes:**
- **Content/Structure:** Use concluding phrases: "To sum up..." "The bigger lesson here is..." Synthesize the main points without introducing new information.
- **Delivery:** Slow down slightly for the summary. Make strong eye contact during "Thank you for your attention." Stand confidently and open body language to invite questions.
- **Visual Aids:** Final slide with key takeaway in large text: "Task design matters as much as the AI itself" + contact info or references
- **Language:** "To sum up..." "This reveals..." "Thank you for your attention" (formal closing phrases from Session 4 materials)
