**Oral Presentation Assessment 3 -- Three-minute Thesis (3MT) Presentation**

Date: **Session 13**
Weighting: 20%

### INSTRUCTIONS:

Within **3 minutes** maximum, you need to **explain the aims, the results, and/or the significance of your research*** to a **non-specialist audience (e.g. prospective employers, grant review panels, the public community)**. You should only **use one static PowerPoint slide**. The presentation should be intelligible to laymen who have no/little knowledge of your field. Hence, technical terms should be strictly avoided.

A key requirement of a 3MT presentation is to **simplify your research** effectively using **strategies** such as **metaphors, similes, and daily life examples** in order to engage the public audience. The presentation should be **interactive** using hooks and attention-getters.

You should **upload the presentation slide** to a folder shared by the class lecturer **at least** **two hours before the assessment**.

To prepare for your presentation, you may watch some award-winning examples of the Three-Minute Thesis Competition organised by the University of Queensland:

Note cards with key points may be used during the presentation; however, reading directly from a script is not permitted and will result in a failing grade for the assessment.

### NOTE:
- You will need to evaluate two to four of your classmates' presentations and provide peer feedback using a peer evaluation form. Your lecturer will tell you about the arrangements.
- The reviewers should:
    1. Raise questions during the Q&A session
    2. Complete the evaluation forms
